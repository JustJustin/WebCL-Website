WebCL Interactive Tutorial
Team Name:

Team Members: Landon Abney, Caleb Bauermeister, Justin Egli

Client: Rémi Arnaud 

Introduction to problem:  WebCL is a new technology standard to allow using OpenCL programs to be used in a browser. OpenCL is a framework for performing computations across the CPU and GPU. WebCL is the continuation of this framework into the web. Since it is such a new  technology there are no good locations to learn about WebCL.

Project Description:  To create a tutorial website for WebCL.

Requirements: A complete tutorial website. There are three major features planned, of which only the first is absolutely required, though we plan to complete all three. The main requirement is the core scratch pad and tutorials. The scratchpad will form the base. This will be a javascript interpreter specifically targeted at WebCL. Here code can be run and the results can be easily seen. The tutorials are also part of the bas requirements. These tutorials will take a beginner in WebCl (but not Javascript, there are plenty of resources for that already) through a series of samples, examples, and problems to teach them  the basics of WebCL. After the base requirement is accounts. these would be modest account that track a user's progress through the tutorials. The final requirement is the showcase. Once programmers have learned the basics of WebCl through the tutorials they can turn to the showcase to both see examples of the amazing things others have done with WebCL and add their own creations.
